# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Our Commitment

As a multi-agent system that executes code and interacts with sensitive repositories, security is a core pillar of GLITCHLAB. We prioritize:

* **Deterministic Governance**: Explicit orchestration over unpredictable emergent behavior.


* **Safety Boundaries**: Physical constraints on what agents can touch and execute.


* **Transparent Auditing**: Full logging of every tool call and model interaction.



## 🧪 Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome reports concerning security flaws, especially those related to:

* **Prompt Injection**: Scenarios where agent instructions can be bypassed or hijacked via task definitions or repository content.
* 
**Sandbox Escapes**: Methods to bypass the `ToolExecutor` allowlist or the Git worktree isolation.


* 
**Credential Leaks**: Issues that might cause GLITCHLAB to accidentally commit or log local API keys.



### How to Report

Please **do not open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. Draft a detailed report including steps to reproduce.
2. Email the report to **security@adjective.us**.
3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

GLITCHLAB includes several built-in security features to protect your codebase:

### 1. Tool Allowlisting

Agents do not have arbitrary shell access. They can only execute commands explicitly defined in the `allowed_tools` list within `glitchlab/config.yaml`.

### 2. Workspace Isolation

All agent operations happen in isolated Git worktrees. No agent ever writes directly to your `main` branch.

### 3. Boundary Enforcement

You can define "Protected Paths" (e.g., your core logic or security modules) that require a manual `--allow-core` flag for an agent to modify.

### 4. Firewall Frankie (Security Agent)

Before any Pull Request is created, a dedicated security agent scans the entire diff for dangerous patterns, hardcoded secrets, and supply chain risks.

## ⚠️ User Responsibilities

* **API Key Safety**: Never commit your `.env` file. It is included in the `.gitignore` by default.


* **Plan Review**: Always review the execution plan generated by Professor Zap before approving implementation.


* **Budget Caps**: Set realistic `max_dollars_per_task` limits to prevent runaway model costs.
